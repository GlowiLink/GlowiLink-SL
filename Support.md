### 🛠 Identity & Billing

#### 1. Can I change my Name or Age?
No. To maintain a safe and authentic community, your **Name and Age are permanent** once you save your profile. Even our support team and admins cannot change these details for you. Please ensure they are correct before hitting save!

#### 2. What are the Gender options?
GlowiLink currently supports two gender options: **Male** and **Female**. We do not support other selections at this time.

#### 3. How do Subscriptions work?
* **Manual Renewal:** We never surprise-charge your card. All premium plans are one-time payments. When your time expires, you simply pay again if you wish to continue.
* **Refunds:** All premium purchases are **non-refundable**, except as required by law or the Google Play Refund Policy. Please review the features carefully before upgrading.

### 🔧 Common Fixes

#### 1. Verification Issues
If the "Verify" button doesn't seem to respond, remember it requires a **long press** (hold for 1-2 seconds) rather than a quick tap.

#### 2. Password Reset
If you requested a reset link and it hasn't arrived:
* Check your **Spam** or **Promotions** folder.
* Ensure you are using the same email you registered with.

#### 3. Account Reactivation
If you previously hibernated your account, simply log in. A prompt will appear asking if you'd like to reactivate. Select **Reactivate** to restore your profile.
